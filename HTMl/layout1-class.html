          Offset printing is a common printing technique in which the inked image is transferred (or 
          "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket and then to the printing surface. When used in 
          combination with the lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water,
           the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier. Ink rollers transfer ink 
           
           to the image areas of the image carrier, while a water roller applies a water-based film 
           to the non-image areas.
The modern "web" process feeds a large reel of paper through a large press machine in several parts,
 typically for several meters, which then prints continuously as the paper is fed through.
Development of the offset press came in two versions: in 1875 by Robert Barclay of England for
printing on tin and in 1904 by Ira Washington Rubel of the United States for printing on paper.

[1] Rubel's contemporary in Continental Europe was Kašpar Hermann, the author of the offset 

machine prototype (1904), holder of a patent for an offset disc machine (two rubber transfer 
rollers facing each other) – rolling-press. In 1907, he successfully started printing in Germany
 on his Triumph sheetfed offset press History
Lithography was initially created to be an inexpensive method of reproducing artwork
 This printing process was limited to use on flat, porous surfaces because the printing
  plates were produced from limestone.[3] In fact the word "lithograph", which comes from Greek 
  (λιθογραφία), means "an image from stone" or "written in stone".
The first rotary offset lithographic printing press was created in England and patented in 1875 by
 Robert Barclay.[3] This development combined mid-19th century transfer printing technologies and Richard March Hoe's 1843 rotary printing press—a press that used a metal cylinder instead of a flat stone.[3] The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the stone to the surface of the metal. Later, the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber,[3] which is still the most commonly used material.
